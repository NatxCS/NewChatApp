# NewChatApp
The Kotlin-Firebase Chat App is a personal project developed as a practice project to showcase my skills in mobile app development. Built using Kotlin and Firebase, this app provides a platform for users to engage in real-time conversations.

## Key Features:

1. Real-time Messaging: The app utilizes Firebase's real-time database to ensure instant messaging, allowing users to send and receive messages in real-time.
2. User Authentication: Users can create an account using Firebase Authentication. They can manage their profiles (add a user name and a photo) . 
3. * OTP-based Phone Number Verification: The app employs Firebase's OTP (One-Time Password) verification feature. 
4. Secure Conversations: Once authenticated, users can engage in private conversations with their friends through individual chat threads. They can send text messages and images.
5. Deleting messages: Users can delete messages and images by long-pressing on them. They have the option to delete the message for everyone or just for themselves.
6. Cloud Storage: Firebase Cloud Storage is used for storing and managing user-generated content such as images shared within the app's chat conversations. This ensures reliable storage and fast access to multimedia content.

* **Please note that the OTP-based phone number verification feature relies on Firebase Authentication and the numbers specified in the Firebase console, the app will only work if you use those specific numbers and codes.**
